# Heart-Disease-Predictions-Using-Supervised-Learning
Build a machine-learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on the given features.

Our mission is crystal clear: to build a machine-learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease, using a range of critical features. The right and accurate data can indeed save lives, and we're committed to making a difference.

Let's dive into the key features of our dataset:
1. Age: Age in years.
2. Sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. Chest Pain Type: A crucial indicator of heart health.
4. Blood Pressure: Measured on admission to the hospital.
5. Cholesterol Level: An important serum marker.
6. Fasting Blood Sugar: >120 mg/dL (1 = true, 0 = false).
7. ECG Results: Providing insights into cardiac health.
8. Max Heart Rate: A significant parameter.
9. Exercise-Induced Angina: A yes/no indicator(1=yes; 0 = no)
10. ST Depression: Relative to rest.
11. ST Slope: A critical indicator during exercise.
14. Number of Major Vessels: An important diagnostic measure.
13. Thalassemia Type: Diverse types provide valuable insights.
14. Target: The presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).

Data-driven decisions in healthcare are pivotal, and this project represents the epitome of leveraging data for the greater good. 
This ia predictive model that assist healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate decisions.
